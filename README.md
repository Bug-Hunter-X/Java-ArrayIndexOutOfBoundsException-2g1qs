This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. The `bug.java` file contains code that throws this exception.  The `bugSolution.java` file provides the corrected code.  This exception is thrown when an array index is outside the valid range (0 to array.length -1). The solution emphasizes the importance of careful index management when working with arrays in Java.
